BACKEND:
Abstract this entire mod (ALMOST DONE)
Add a config
cleanup all the code by removing tri-sets and all.

STAINED_FORESTS:
Make stained forests extremely rare and a small FLAT biome.
Make the stained trees spawn in plains once again but very, very rarely.

CRYSTALS:
Make crystal caves and change the corundum textures. Connect geodes to crystal caves for a sick entrance.

CLOUDS:
    GENERAL:
    Remove all except white clouds spawn in the air (and change the spawning pattern to be unique)
    Fix rendering of clouds to render like trees (including all cloud-based blocks such as wood, grass).

    BIOME:
    Make an extremely rare biome for cloud trees with a new, weak type of log. Add floating islands on it as well.
    For these floating islands, make it "held up" by strings of cloud.
    Add some tiny floating clouds above the cloud biome.
    Add a cloudy, semi-transparent grass and piles of cloud foliage.

    CLOUD_ADJUSTMENTS:
    Make an item (similar to wax) that is crafted using a block of regular cloud surrounded by amethyst shards to disable cloud features (if it's just for decor).
    Make compact variants for clouds with the above item surrounded by designated cloud.
    Make stair and slab variants of these clouds so one can actually build a cloud house.
    Make storm cloud "whirl you up into the sky"
    Make teal cloud named ender cloud and able to very rarely randomly spawn you somewhere within 10 blocks.
    Make redstone cloud activate when player is inside.
    Make blazing cloud set you on fire.
    Make irradiated cloud able to very rarely randomly insta-kill you.
    Make pink cloud randomly and infrequently give 1-5 seconds of level 1 regeneration.

MEADOW:
Make meadow a flatter biome with big lakes
Make it seperate from the vanilla one (add some suffix)

MAPLE:
change the textures to be entirely mine and to just look better (it looks horrible now). Take inspiration from BOP Maple.
Make the maple log able to be farmed for 6 bottles of maple syrup. If it's full make it drop a liquid block of maple syrup.
